= Ticketee application


== Introduction

This application has been developed 
while reading http://www.manning.com/bigg2/[Rails in Action 4] book
by Ryan Bigg, Yehuda Katz, and Steve Klabnik.

When completed, the application will: 

- Track tickets and group them into projects
- Provide a way to restrick user to certain projects
- Allow users to upload file to tickets
- Let users tag ticket so they're easy to find
- Provide an API on which user can base development of their own applications


My goal is to follow along while making the following changes:

- Use Minitest instead of RSpec
- Use Slim instead of erb templates. (I positively hate erb)
- Use PostgreSql instead of sqlite3
- Use rbenv insted of Rv

I use a https://github.com/rhc/dotfiles/blob/master/rails/template.rb[rails template file]  to initialize my application



== Using minitest
