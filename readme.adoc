= Ticketee application


== Introduction

This application has been developed 
while reading http://www.manning.com/bigg2/[Rails in Action 4] book
by Ryan Bigg, Yehuda Katz, and Steve Klabnik.


My goal is to follow along while making the following changes:

- Use Minitest instead of RSpec
- Use Slim instead of erb templates. (I positively hate erb)
- Use PostgreSql instead of sqlite3
- Use rbenv insted of Rv

I use a https://github.com/rhc/dotfiles/blob/master/rails/template.rb[rails template file]  to initialize my application
